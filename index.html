          Ever Since I was a little kid, software development was has been my passion. 
          I still remember sitting in front of Dell Optiplex Gx620 loaded with Python IDE making it print "Hello World" for the very first time. 
          As I went through the Python tutorial, it was like magic, being able to have a computer that does whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, 
          limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Through middle and high school, I latched on to any idea for projects I can get. 
          Moving from "Hello World!" all the way to Person Shooter engine, with dozens of projects in between. 
          I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was Insatiable.
          
          This passion carried me through my education at SUZA. Here there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. 
          I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, discrete mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid.
          And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.
